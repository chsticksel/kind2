(** Hash tables for hash consing

    Hash consed values are of the following type [hash_consed]. The
    field [tag] contains a unique integer (for values hash consed with
    the same table). The field [hkey] contains the hash key of the
    value (without modulo) for possible use in other hash tables (and
    internally when hash consing tables are resized). The field [node]
    contains the value itself. The field [prop] contains properties of
    some type associated with the hashconsed value.

    Values added to a hashcons table are never garbage collected.
