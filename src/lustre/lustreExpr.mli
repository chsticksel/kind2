(** Internal reperesentation of a Lustre expression

    A {!LustreExpr.t} does not contain node calls, temporal operators
    or expressions under a [pre] operator.

    There is exactly one [->] operator at the top of the expression,
    thus an expression can be represented as a pair of expressions
    [(i, t)] without [->] operators. 

    The argument of a [pre] operator is always a variable, therefore
    an expression [pre x] can be represented by the variable [x] at
    the previous state.

    A non-variable expression under a [pre] has to be abstracted to a
    fresh variable that is defined by this expression. There are no
    node calls in a Lustre expression. They have to be abstracted out
    and the results are captured in fresh variables. See
    {!LustreSimplify} for details about how the input file is
    translated.

    The offsets of state variable instances are zero for the initial
    state and zero for the current state, see the constants
    {!base_offset} and {!cur_offset} and {!pre_offset}. These are
    different from the offsets in the transition system, because here
    we want to know if the initial and the step expressions are equal
    without bumping offsets. Use the functions {!base_term_of_expr},
    {!cur_term_of_expr}, and {!pre_term_of_expr} to take the
    expression on one side of the [->] operator and adjust to the
    variable offsets to the given base.

    Expressions can only be constructed with the constructors which do
    type checking and some easy simplifications with constants.
